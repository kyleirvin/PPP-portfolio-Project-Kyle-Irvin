# This Repository contains the code used in my Analysis of the PPP Loan Project.

My name is Kyle Irvin. This project was independently done to demonstrate my data analysis skills. I am currently looking for a position as a junior analyst, please contact kyle.ch.irvin@gmail.com with any opportunities that may fit my background.

To recreate this project, please download the PPP data from https://data.sba.gov/dataset/ppp-foia. These files come in multiple excel files, use the consolidator to combine them into one file.

Loan amount based on business age.R contains code written in Rstudio that consists of aggregation queries and a plot created with ggplot2

PPP Loan consolidation Kyle Irvin Visualizations.R contains code written in Rstudio 

PPP Data Consolidation Script.ipynb contains code written in Python containing all 12 data sets used for the project consolidated into a singular dataset. The data was then slimmed down to 10 columns from 53 columns containing the most important information needed for this project.

PPP Portfolio Aggregations and Plots.ipynb contains code written in Python containing queries to create separate dataframes and saving them as new csv files, and plots pertaining to the distribution of loan size and the distribution of jobs created.
